The Plate & Case Builder (builder) is a tool to aid in the design and creation of custom keyboards.  The builder generates CAD files to be cut by a laser cutter.


Keyboard layouts are created at <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/" target="_blank">keyboard-layout-editor.com</a> (KLE) and the `Raw data` is **copied**.
